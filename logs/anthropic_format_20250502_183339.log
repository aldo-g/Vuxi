PROMPT:
You are tasked with formatting a UX/UI analysis into a structured JSON format that can be easily parsed and displayed in a web report.

Extract the following from the analysis:

1. SCORES:
   - Extract all numerical scores on a 1-10 scale for each category mentioned
   - For each score, include the category name, numerical value, and a brief description of what the score means

2. CRITICAL ISSUES:
   - Extract all critical issues or flaws mentioned in the analysis
   - For each issue, include a title, severity level (High/Medium/Low), description, and the area affected

3. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Extract all specific recommendations for improvement
   - For each recommendation, include a title, impact level (High/Medium/Low), description, and the area it would improve

4. SUMMARY:
   - Extract or create a concise overall summary (2-3 sentences max)
   - Include the overall effectiveness score if mentioned

Please return a JSON structure with these exact keys:
{
  "scores": [
    {"category": "Brand Identity", "score": 7, "description": "Brief explanation of score..."},
    ...
  ],
  "critical_issues": [
    {"title": "Issue title", "severity": "High", "description": "Issue details...", "area": "Affected area"},
    ...
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {"title": "Recommendation title", "impact": "High", "description": "Recommendation details...", "area": "Area to improve"},
    ...
  ],
  "summary": {
    "text": "Concise overall summary...",
    "overall_score": 6
  }
}

Important notes:
- Analyze the text to extract accurate information, don't invent scores or issues
- If a particular section is missing in the original analysis, include an empty array for that key
- Format numeric scores as numbers, not strings (e.g., 7 not "7")
- The summary should be 2-3 sentences maximum
- Maintain the original meaning and intent of the analysis throughout


ANALYSIS TEXT (FIRST 500 CHARS):
# UX/UI Analysis: Edinburgh Peace Institute Research Page

## 1. FIRST IMPRESSION & CLARITY (Score: 6/10)

**EVIDENCE:**
- The page has a clear title "Research, Ethics, & Protection Policy" that establishes the general topic
- The layout is clean with distinct sections separated by headings
- The structure follows a logical flow from introduction to methodology to protection principles
- However, the connection between research and the organization's goals (donations, trainings) is not immediate...
