PROMPT:
You are tasked with formatting a UX/UI analysis into a structured JSON format that can be easily parsed and displayed in a web report.

Extract the following from the analysis:

1. SCORES:
   - Extract all numerical scores on a 1-10 scale for each category mentioned
   - For each score, include the category name, numerical value, and a brief description of what the score means

2. CRITICAL ISSUES:
   - Extract all critical issues or flaws mentioned in the analysis
   - For each issue, include a title, severity level (High/Medium/Low), description, and the area affected

3. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Extract all specific recommendations for improvement
   - For each recommendation, include a title, impact level (High/Medium/Low), description, and the area it would improve

4. SUMMARY:
   - Extract or create a concise overall summary (2-3 sentences max)
   - Include the overall effectiveness score if mentioned

Please return a JSON structure with these exact keys:
{
  "scores": [
    {"category": "Brand Identity", "score": 7, "description": "Brief explanation of score..."},
    ...
  ],
  "critical_issues": [
    {"title": "Issue title", "severity": "High", "description": "Issue details...", "area": "Affected area"},
    ...
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {"title": "Recommendation title", "impact": "High", "description": "Recommendation details...", "area": "Area to improve"},
    ...
  ],
  "summary": {
    "text": "Concise overall summary...",
    "overall_score": 6
  }
}

Important notes:
- Analyze the text to extract accurate information, don't invent scores or issues
- If a particular section is missing in the original analysis, include an empty array for that key
- Format numeric scores as numbers, not strings (e.g., 7 not "7")
- The summary should be 2-3 sentences maximum
- Maintain the original meaning and intent of the analysis throughout


ANALYSIS TEXT (FIRST 500 CHARS):
# UX/UI Analysis: Edinburgh Peace Institute Contact Page

## 1. FIRST IMPRESSION & CLARITY (Score: 5/10)
The page clearly presents itself as a contact form for Edinburgh Peace Institute with a minimal design approach. However, there is no heading that explicitly states "Contact Us" or any introductory text explaining the purpose of the form. The large EPI branding and organizational name dominate the visual hierarchy, while the actual contact form appears secondary. A visitor can understand this...
