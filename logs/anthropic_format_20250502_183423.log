   - Include the overall effectiveness score if mentioned

Please return a JSON structure with these exact keys:
{
  "scores": [
    {"category": "Brand Identity", "score": 7, "description": "Brief explanation of score..."},
    ...
  ],
  "critical_issues": [
    {"title": "Issue title", "severity": "High", "description": "Issue details...", "area": "Affected area"},
    ...
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {"title": "Recommendation title", "impact": "High", "description": "Recommendation details...", "area": "Area to improve"},
    ...
  ],
  "summary": {
    "text": "Concise overall summary...",
    "overall_score": 6
  }
}

Important notes:
- Analyze the text to extract accurate information, don't invent scores or issues
- If a particular section is missing in the original analysis, include an empty array for that key
- Format numeric scores as numbers, not strings (e.g., 7 not "7")
- The summary should be 2-3 sentences maximum
- Maintain the original meaning and intent of the analysis throughout


ANALYSIS TEXT (FIRST 500 CHARS):
# UX/UI Analysis: Edinburgh Peace Institute Projects Page
