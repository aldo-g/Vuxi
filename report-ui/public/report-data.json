    "executive_summary": "The Edinburgh Peace Institute website exhibits strong technical performance and professional visual design but critically fails to achieve its primary goals of encouraging donations and training sign-ups. The site presents valuable content about the organization's research, projects, and training offerings but lacks the strategic conversion elements necessary to transform visitor interest into action. While the organization demonstrates credibility through its team credentials and content quality, the website's conversion architecture is fundamentally flawed with limited donation opportunities, hidden training registration pathways, and disconnected user journeys that fail to guide visitors toward desired actions.",

Lack of Alternative Conversion Paths (Severity: High) - When users encounter an empty cart, the page fails to provide alternative actions that support organizational goals such as highlighting training programs or suggesting donations.\n\n3. Disconnected User Journey (Severity: Medium) - The \"Continue Shopping\" button doesn't specify where it leads or what users might find, creating uncertainty in the user journey.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:\n1. Add Recommended Trainings Section (Impact: High) - Implement a \"Popular Trainings\" or \"Upcoming Courses\" section with images, brief descriptions, and direct \"Add to Cart\" buttons to provide immediate shopping options.\n\n2. Incorporate Donation Appeal (Impact: High) - Add a compelling donation call-to-action with multiple suggested amounts and impact statements to support the organization's fundraising goals.\n\n3. Enhance Continue Shopping Button Context (Impact: Medium) - Rename the button to be more specific (e.g., \"Browse Training Courses\") and ensure it links directly to purchasable offerings.\n\n4. Add Informational Context (Impact: Medium) - Include a brief explanation of what can be purchased through the site (e.g., \"The Edinburgh Peace Institute offers training courses and educational resources that support our mission\").\n\n5. Implement Cart Recovery Features (Impact: Low) - For returning users who previously added items, show \"Previously viewed\" or \"Items you might be interested in\" sections to encourage re-engagement.\n\n## SUMMARY:\nOverall effectiveness score: 4/10\n\nThe Edinburgh Peace Institute cart page is technically well-implemented but critically fails to support the organization's goals of encouraging donations and training sign-ups. While the page loads quickly and is accessible, it misses numerous opportunities to engage users, provide context about available offerings, and guide them toward conversion actions. The highest priority should be adding recommended training courses and donation options directly on the empty cart page to provide clear next steps for users.\n\n## PAGE ROLE ANALYSIS:\nAs a cart page, this implementation fulfills only the most basic functional requirement of showing cart status. It's missing several expected elements for an empty cart page, including product recommendations, \"continue shopping\" guidance, and alternative conversion paths. The page fails to effectively connect to other parts of the user journey, providing only a generic way back but no specific direction toward purchasable items or donation options. Given the organization's goals, the empty cart represents a missed opportunity to guide users toward meaningful engagement.",

GOAL ALIGNMENT (Score: 3/10)\n- The page does very little to support the website's purpose of encouraging donations and training sign-ups\n- While a \"Donate\" button exists in the navigation, there are no mentions of trainings on this page\n- The empty cart lacks recommendations, featured items, or any content that would drive conversions\n- EVIDENCE: No training offerings are highlighted, no donation appeals appear on the empty cart page, and the \"Continue Shopping\" button doesn't specify what can be purchased\n\n## 3. VISUAL DESIGN (Score: 6/10)\n- The design is clean and uncluttered with appropriate use of white space\n- Minimal color palette maintains brand consistency\n- The layout is simple and professional but lacks visual interest or emotional appeal\n- EVIDENCE: The page uses a clean black and white design consistent with the organization's logo, but lacks imagery or design elements that would engage users or communicate the organization's mission\n\n## 4.

Implement Impact Statements (Impact: Medium) - Add brief statements to each project that quantify impact (e.g., \"This initiative has trained 200+ peacebuilders\") to build credibility and motivate action.\n\n4. Enhance Visual Hierarchy (Impact: Medium) - Increase contrast between headings and body text, and visually emphasize the most important information in each project card to improve scannability.\n\n5. Add Social Proof Elements (Impact: Medium) - Incorporate testimonials, partner logos, or success metrics alongside projects to build trust and encourage engagement.\n\n## SUMMARY:\n- Overall effectiveness score: 6/10\n- The Projects page effectively showcases the organization's work with good technical implementation and clean design, but critically fails to provide clear pathways for visitors to donate or register for trainings, which significantly undermines the website's core purpose. The professional presentation builds credibility but doesn't capitalize on visitor interest by converting it to action.\n- Highest priority action: Implement clear, contextual donation and registration CTAs throughout the page to create direct conversion paths from project interest to visitor action.\n\n## PAGE ROLE ANALYSIS:\nThis Projects page effectively catalogs the organization's initiatives but falls short in its role within the broader user journey. As a showcase of the organization's work, it should not only inform but also inspire action. The page is missing crucial elements expected on a non-profit project page, including: specific ways to get involved with each project, donation options tied to specific initiatives, upcoming training dates/registration links, and impact metrics that would motivate support. While the page successfully connects to the organization's mission, it fails to connect users to next steps in their journey from awareness to action.",

FIRST IMPRESSION & CLARITY (Score: 5/10)\n- The page is immediately identifiable as a contact form, but lacks context about why a visitor would want to contact the organization\n- The large \"EPI\" background graphic dominates the page without conveying purpose or value\n- No page heading or introductory text explaining the purpose of the contact form\n- Navigation is clear but the Contact page is already selected without visual distinction\n- EVIDENCE: The form appears immediately without explanatory text; large \"EPI\" graphic takes up significant visual space without adding functional value\n\n## 2. GOAL ALIGNMENT (Score: 4/10)\n- While the Donate button is present in the navigation, it doesn't receive enough prominence given the organization's goals\n- No mention of trainings or how contacting relates to the organization's offerings\n- Missing opportunities to convert visitors through strategic CTAs or related content\n- No explanation of what happens after submitting the form or expected response time\n- EVIDENCE: Form exists in isolation without connecting to core goals; no secondary content promoting trainings or explaining how messages will be handled\n\n## 3. VISUAL DESIGN (Score: 6/10)\n- Clean, minimalist aesthetic with consistent brand colors\n- The large \"EPI\" background graphic creates visual interest but dominates the page\n- Form styling is simple and functional with adequate spacing\n- Contrasting blue form against the black/white background creates clear focus\n- EVIDENCE: Form stands out visually on the page; typography is consistent with brand; form fields are clearly distinguished\n\n## 4.
